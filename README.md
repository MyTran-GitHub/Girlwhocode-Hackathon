# Girlwhocode-Hackathon
My team created a website that connects conservation projects in deforestation-alarming areas with volunteers. The website integrates a map of global deforestation by querying JSON data from the Global Forest Watch API. Users can interact with the map to learn more about deforestation status, and conservation status and find/get matched with volunteering opportunities.
